# mLinks
NodeJS url shortener made rediculously simple.
URL shortening is a technique which a URL may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect on a domain name that is short, which links to the web page that has a long URL. 

#Example
The URL "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" can be shortened to "http://mLink.com/murl". This is especially convenient for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters that may be used in a message
